# Code Readme

Our code is all stored in the main.c file in the main folder.
The code is divided into six parts, distributed in the following order:
- Rubric No.1: Keeps track of time using hardware timer
- Rubric No.2: Measures input from solar cell
- Rubric No.4: Drives two servos to position of maximum intensity
- Rubric No.3: Finds azimuth and altitude at maximum intensity
- Rubric No.5: Cyclic behavior at design frequency driven by clock (not delays)
- Rubric No.6: Reports results on display in degrees
- app_main

Notes: There is no codes under "Rubric No.5: Cyclic behavior at design frequency driven by clock (not delays)" parts, all relative codes are in the app_main.

All the code we use is quoted from the previous Skills, except for the original part.
