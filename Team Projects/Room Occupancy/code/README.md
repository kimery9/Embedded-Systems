Contained within the 'main' folder above, there is a main.c file. This file is responsible for getting the sensor readings, performing the room occupancy algorithm, and sending information to be parsed into CSV. 

Contained within the 'CanvasJS' folder above, there is a canvas_example.js file which is responsible for moving our HTML file onto the local host. The data.csv file is the all of the sensor data. The own-data.html file is where the data is brought in, parsed, and applied to a CanvasJS chart.
